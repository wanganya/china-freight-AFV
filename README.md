# china-freight-AFV
# Overview
This repository contains all codes of the paper - ??
# Requirements and Installation
The whole analysis-related codes should run with a **Python** environment, regardless of operating systems theoretically. We successfully execute all the codes in both Windows (Win10, Win11) machines and a macOS (Sequoia 15.2) machine. More detailed info is as below:
# Prerequisites
It is highly recommended to install and use the following versions of python/packages to run the codes:
## 01FreightTripODGeneration.py
   - ``python``==3.9
   - ``numpy``==1.24.3
   - ``pandas``==2.0.3
   - ``psutil``==5.9.5
## 02DetailedFreightTripsGeneration.py
   - ``python``==3.9
   - ``qgis``==3.34.1
   - ``numpy``==1.26.4
   - ``pandas``==2.2.3
   - ``tqdm``==4.67.1
   - ``geopandas``==1.0.1
   - ``openpyxl``==3.1.5
## codes in the dir./SimulationOptimization/...
   - ``numpy``>=1.20.0
   - ``pandas``>=1.3.0
   - ``matplotlib``>=3.4.0
   - ``seaborn``>=0.11.0
   - ``geopandas``>=0.10.0
   - ``PyYAML``>=6.0
   - ``psutil``>=5.9.0
   - ``openpyxl``>=3.0.9
   - ``pyarrow``>=6.0.0
   - ``shapely``>=1.8.0
   - ``fiona``>=1.8.20
   - ``rtree``>=1.0.0
# Installation
It is highly recommended to download AnaConda to create/manage Python environments. You can create a new Python environment and install required aforementioned packages via both the GUI or Command Line. Typically, the installation should be prompt (around 10-20 min from a "_clean_" machine to "_ready-to-use_" machine, but highly dependent on the Internet speed)
